- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @0xMemoryGrinder
I'm an Epitech Student, currently in 3rd year.

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Blockchain development
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity, NestJS, React and Flutter
- ğŸš€ I'm working on a new version of PolymorphEngine, check out the organisation [link](https://github.com/PolymorphEngine).
Most of my repositories are in private so you won't see a lot of my work :(
